Micro Python programming
The coding was successful.

I had difficulty in thinking of how the game goes and what are the variables that I should give them. For me to remedy these difficulties, the first one watch how some professionals use blocks to write out the program, as these kind of give me the hint of how to complete this program; for the second difficulty, I watched serval videos on YOUTUBE of how people play this game so that I will know what are the variables that I should include in my game.

The main obstacle for me is that, I not very strong in coding, especially I have never coded an animated programme before. I didn’t know how to start the code and the unfamiliarised of python makes me more confused as I was typing a semicolon at every end of my line.

The tip is there are many functions in the Micro bit, know them, use them. They will help you in the process of coding. Watch some videos or tutorials as someone might did it before you, learn from them. 


The video on Thonny IDE for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLOOWVwDftg
This video does not start from the basic like “hello word”, so for most of the users who already know such thing, they don’t have to waste too much time on it.
Secondly, this video teaches how to use python extension(py) and Shell at the same time, unlike running the python PowerShell.

This video gives a full guide on how to install python, setting up system variable, where the beginners will not be confused.
